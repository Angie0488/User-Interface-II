    <h1> ABOUT </h1>

    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p>
            My name is Angie Lawrence, I am 29 years old and I am currently a part time student at Lambda School.  I am also
            a stay at home mother to three beautiful little girls.  I am failry new to coding but believe this is what I am meant 
            to do.  I enjoy the challange that Web Developement is, and feel that with that comes an even greater reward.  I am 
            looking forward to all that lambda has to offer, and all the projects I will create during my time here both in class 
            and on my own.
